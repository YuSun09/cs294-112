## CS294-112 Assignment Solutions
Solutions to the fall 2018 edition of the assignments for [CS294-112: Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/)

Based on the video lectures from the [Fall 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkFD6_40KJIznC9CDbVTjAF2oyt8_VAe3) edition of the course.

## Installation
[Starting code](https://github.com/berkeleydeeprlcourse/homework)

To be able to run the code for each homework, please start by following the instructions from each homework's PDF
(linked with each assignment below) about how to install the homework. As for setting up a Python environment, the
provided `cs294.yml` file is a `conda` requirements file that you can use to create a conda environment using the
following command:
```bash
conda env create -f cs294.yml
``` 
This will create a conda environment named `cs294`.
